Install, Use & Enjoy command 'airmise-ng' currently not available, i am making .deb file to make it install & play ready,
airmise-ng name made to hold the wifi hacking traditions of popular air-ng series scripts,
So its a remix of aireplay-ng,airodump-ng,aircrack-ng,airmon-ng,mdk3,fluxion/linset,bully,reaver,pixiewps/pixiedust,hashcat and some other mores!
